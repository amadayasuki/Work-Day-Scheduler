# Work-Day-Scheduler 
Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

Starter code came from: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/super-disco

### Acceptance Criteria 
I was tasked to ensure the following:

1. When I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
2. WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
3. WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
4. WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event
5. WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
6. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
